* What is this? 
This is my attempt to go through Norvig's [[https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp][Paradigm's of AI
Programming]]. We used this text in college but that was over a decade
ago now.

As I generally try to do, I'll write up my work with org-mode and
org-babel for a literate walkthrough of the code. Both the code
provided by Norvig and the code I write in working the exercises.
